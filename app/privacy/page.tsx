            At this time, GagHub does not use cookies, trackers, or analytics
            tools. If we ever add them in the future (for improving site

            This site may contain links to external websites (such as Roblox or
            community resources). We are not responsible for the privacy
            practices of those websites.

          <p>
            Since GagHub is an informational fan site, it is safe for all
            audiences. However, please remember that Roblox itself has its own
            privacy and safety rules, which you should review when playing.

            will be reflected on this page with an updated date.
